As a celebration of 2025, I rebuilt my new portfolio website with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## About technology

I adopted [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is a framework which enables us to create OSS document websites easily. Thanks to its wonderful functions, we can also use it for building own website. 

The reasons why I adopted Docusaurus are as follows

- Easy to support multiple languages
- Most of features for supporting tech blog are ready when we initialize a Docusaurus project
  - Markdown notation is supported by default.
  - Syntax highlight is included in standard functions
  - Sophisticated default design
- Easy to create custom page with React


I have built similar portfolio sites using a variety of frameworks, including Hugo, Gatsby, SvelteKit, Next.js, and Nuxt.js. However, Docusaurus is the best way to do it for me. I found Docusaurus to be easiest to buid and maintain, with less effort to write CSS for responsive design.  

I intend to use this site to contribute a variety of content in the future.
