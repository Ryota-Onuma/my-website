## Introduction

Many learners mix up **be used to (gerund / noun)**, **get used to (gerund / noun)**, **adjust to (gerund / noun)**, and **adapt to (gerund / noun)**.  
They look similar, but the _feeling_ is different.  
In this post I break them down in very simple English and Japanese.  
You will also see short stories you can memorize for speaking practice.
